This code can read in a freeze out surface from 3+1D viscous hydro or anisotropic
viscous hydro and calculate 3D smooth particle spectra or a sampled particle list.
The structure is based on iSpectra, the Cooper Frye code in the iEBE heavy ion
event generator (Chun Shen, Zhi Qiu).

to build iS3D, one can do

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install

To run iS3D, do

$ ./iS3D

or

$ sh runCPU.sh num_threads

where num_threads is the number of cpu threads.

The freezeout surface is read from input/surface.dat, or from memory depending on how the wrapper is called.
By default input/surface.dat contains a toy freezeout surface with one cell.
See parameters.dat for a list of compatible formats.

The results will be written in the results/ directory, so this directory must exist at runtime.
