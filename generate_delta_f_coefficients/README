Running one of the following scripts:

generate_vh_coeff_urqmd.sh
generate_vh_coeff_smash.sh
generate_vh_coeff_smash_box.sh

will pull one of the three pdg list of resonances

PDG/pdg-urqmdv3.3+.dat 
PDG/pdg_smash.dat 
PDG/pdg_box.dat

and generate the corresponding 14 moment and Chapman Enskog coefficients, which depend on the HRG. These coefficient tables are stored in deltaf_coefficients/vh

* one should take note that the pdg_box.dat file format is different than the urqmd and smash ones. 


For example, to run iS3D with the smash HRG, one should 

1. run generate_vh_coeff_smash.sh

2. set hrg_eos = 2 in iS3D_parameters.dat

2. run iS3D
