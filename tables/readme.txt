The momentum tables are used for computing the smooth Cooper-Frye spectra

	column 1 = momentum coordinates
	column 2 = integration weights (used for integrating spectra, e.g. dN/twopipTdpTdy and v2)

Spacetime rapidity tables are also needed to extend 2+1d boost-invariant surfaces to 3+1d

Gauss legendre and laguerra tables are needed in several routines
